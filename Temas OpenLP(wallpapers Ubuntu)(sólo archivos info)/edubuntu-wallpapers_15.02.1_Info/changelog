edubuntu-artwork (14.03.1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * Fix our default wallpaper. It used to come from ubuntu-wallpapers
    but was removed from there, so copy it over to edubuntu-wallpapers to
    make sure we always have it around...

edubuntu-artwork (13.12.1) trusty; urgency=low

  * Don't use hardcoded path to dpkg-divert as this has a tendency to
    blow up when things get moved (as was the case a few days ago...).

edubuntu-artwork (13.10.1) saucy; urgency=low

  * A previous change moved the default wallpaper from
    edubuntu_default.png to edubuntu_default.jpg. This isn't a big
    problem in itself but things (old installs, the installer, ...) still
    refer to the .png filename, so make sure we ship a symlink. Also fix the
    postinst to touch both paths (just to be safe).

edubuntu-artwork (13.09.1) saucy; urgency=low
